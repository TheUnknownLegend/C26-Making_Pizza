Step 1...: Make the dough from mixing the wheat flour, maida , 1 to 2 tablespoon of oil and yeast (you can mix how water you want but it should have a very good consistent)

Step 2...: Leave the dough for 3 to 6 Hours in a air tight container.

Step 3...: Use a pan with lid (note: you can use oven but it should require covention mode and has to provide heat from both sides) , oil or butter the pan (no olive oil) , heat the pan on low flame (if using oven temperature should be set to 200*C )(and also note that oven user you should also use pan to half cook the pizza base ), after heating, half cook the pizza base only on one side which we use to put the toppings.

Step 4....: After cooking one side of the pizza base , spread the puree on the half cooked side , shread the cheese(you can use any cheese but i suggest mozzarella)and sprinkle some of it on the pizza.

Step 5....: with my type of topping , i usually half cook my toppings and some salt , soy-sause and vineager , pepper , some schezwan sause or chutney , with some dried herbs .

Step 6....: Now spread the toppings all your pizza and sprinkle all the cheese left.

Step 7....: Now close the lid on your pan (no need to be air tight but the heat should escape) and cook it on low flame for 6 to 10mins (I prefer 8 mins ) check the pizza , don't let it burn , so check on the bottom of the pizza.

Step 8....: (This is only for owen users) Skip the step 7 and (convention mode)preheat your owen to 200*C and cook the pizza for 25mins 

Step 9....: Take out the pizza or stop cooking it and cut it equal parts share to others and yourself and sit back and enjoy.

NOTE: I usually prefer pan pizza. This is not perfect and still can be modified and if you follow all steps correctly it might not good so it takes time and do trial and error method and change the taste and toppings to your to taste.
